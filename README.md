# Linux Things

This repo includes stuff for my build server and other Linux instances. I'll try to update this for what each thing is/does

1. .bashrc: my home bashrc file which includes some Git aliases and functions for basic functions on my box
2. motd.sh: my MOTD script (placed in /etc/profile.d and touch ~/.hushlogin to suppress last login message)
